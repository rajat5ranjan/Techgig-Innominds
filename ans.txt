Hello,<br /><br />After I sent you the Skype request I waited more than 1hour for your response. I am working from India at that time it's almost 12AM IST here, so I went to offline. Here we will be available from morning 9AM IST to 9PM IST.<br /><br />If possible please ping us between these working hours so that we will fix the reported issue.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Nagaraj.
Hello Ravi,<br /><br />As discussed, I have tried with the above troubleshoot options but could see the OS drive got locked which is not supporting us toÂ reset the password from rootÂ end and even tried to recover the OS. Even we don't have the password records for this laptop with us.<br /><br />As we suggest you, Its better to replace the laptop from abc office at the US.<br /><br /><strong> Regards,</strong><br />Nagaraj.<br />

Verify that your computer is able to see the Internet and/or other computers to ensure that your computer is not encountering a connection issue, which would be causing your e-mail issue. Ensure that your Internet e-mail server or your Network e-mail server is not encountering issues by contacting either your Internet Service Provider or your Network administrator.

First check the computer's power cord to make sure it is completely plugged into the wall socket. If you are using a plug strip, make sure it is completely plugged into the wall socket and that the power switch on the plug strip is turned on. Some plug strips also have a built in circuit breaker which usually looks like a black or red button near the power switch. Press the button to reset it and see if that solves the problem.
